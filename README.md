# PDF Chatbot | Fidelity LEAP 5-Month Interns Workshop

This repository is part of the Gen AI Workshop conducted for the Fidelity LEAP 5-Month Interns. The workshop introduces the interns to the world of Generative AI with LLMs. It focuses on the implementation of a RAG Chatbot that can answer questions based on the content of multiple PDF documents. It uses open-source components like ChromaDB, BGE embedding models and Llama3 (via Groq).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the cells in the provided `RAG Chatbot Workshop.ipynb` notebook. You can also run the notebook in Google Colab by clicking the badge below.

## Further Learning and Resources

### Resources from LlamaIndex
[LLamaIndex Docs](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/) are really good if you want to get good understanding of every component and even look at under the hood of RAG.

### Short Courses from DeepLearning.AI

[Short Courses of DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/) are really good if you want to get a good understanding via hands-on guided projects in their platform for free (as of published date).
